      <section class="section" aria-labelledby="subscriptions">
        <h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Direct Sales Network cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Direct Sales Network customer support team. A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
